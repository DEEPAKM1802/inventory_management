The following excel file is made for inventory mangement used in our optical lab.

The first sheet (OAL form) is used to add record of how many units have we built.

The second sheet "Records" is a log of units that were manufactured.

The logs file is used to vizualize production per month and how many material we utilized and the currenrt stock of our inventory.

The file will be enhanched for all the 250 componets eventually.

The excel uses Power query, Macros, lookup functions and many more advance excel functionality to build an inventory mangement system that can be used across departments.
